# Medienreaktor.Meilisearch

Integrates Meilisearch into Neos. *This is Work-in-Progress!*

This package aims for simplicity and minimal dependencies. It might therefore not be as sophisticated and extensible as packages like [Flowpack.ElasticSearch.ContentRepositoryAdaptor](https://github.com/Flowpack/Flowpack.ElasticSearch.ContentRepositoryAdaptor), and to achieve this, some code parts had to be copied from these great packages (see Credits).

## ‚ú® Features

* ‚úÖ Indexing the Neos Content Repository in Meilisearch
* ‚úÖ Supports Content Dimensions for all node variants
* ‚úÖ CLI commands for building and flushing the index
* ‚úÖ Querying the index via Eel-Helpers as usually
* ‚úÖ Faceting query to get facet distribution for node properties
* üü† Only indexing the Live-Workspace for now
* üü† Documentation (this README) just covers the basics
* üî¥ No asset indexing (yet)
* üî¥ No autocomplete / autosuggest (yet)
* üî¥ No frontend plugin (yet, but can be used with [Flowpack.SearchPlugin](https://github.com/Flowpack/Flowpack.SearchPlugin))

## üöÄ Installation

Install via composer:

    composer require medienreaktor/meilisearch

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Configure the Meilisearch client in your `Settings.yaml` and set the Endpoint and API Key:

```yaml
Medienreaktor:
  Meilisearch:
    client:
      endpoint: ''
      apiKey: ''
```

You can adjust all Meilisearch index settings to fit your needs (see [Meilisearch Documentation](https://www.meilisearch.com/docs/reference/api/settings)):

```yaml
Medienreaktor:
  Meilisearch:
    settings:
      filterableAttributes:
        - '__identifier'
        - '__dimensionshash'
        - '__path'
        - '__parentPath'
        - '__type'
        - '__typeAndSupertypes'
        - '_hidden'
        - '_hiddenBeforeDateTime'
        - '_hiddenAfterDateTime'
        - '_hiddenInIndex'
      searchableAttributes:
        - '__fulltext.text'
        - '__fulltext.h1'
        - '__fulltext.h2'
        - '__fulltext.h3'
        - '__fulltext.h4'
        - '__fulltext.h5'
        - '__fulltext.h6'
```

Please do not remove, only extend, above `filterableAttributes`, as they are needed for base functionality to work.

After finishing or changing configuration, build the node index once via the CLI command `flow nodeindex:build`. 

Document-NodeTypes should be configured as fulltext root (this comes by default for all `Neos.Neos:Document` subtypes):

```yaml
'Neos.Neos:Document':
  search:
    fulltext:
      isRoot: true
      enable: true
```

Properties of Content-NodeTypes that should be included in fulltext search must also be configured appropriately:

```yaml
'Neos.NodeTypes:Text':
  search:
    fulltext:
      enable: true
  properties:
    text:
      search:
        fulltextExtractor: "${Indexing.extractHtmlTags(node.properties.text)}"
```

## üìñ Usage

You can use search queries, results and facets in your Fusion components as usually:

    prototype(Vendor:Content.Search) < prototype(Neos.Neos:ContentComponent) {
        searchTerm = ${String.toString(request.arguments.search)}
        searchQuery = ${this.searchTerm ? Search.query(site).fulltext(this.searchTerm).nodeType('Neos.Neos:Document') : null}

        totalSearchResults = ${this.searchQuery.count()}
        facets = ${this.searchQuery.facets(['__type'])}
    }

If you want facet distribution for certain node properties or search in them, make sure to add them to `filterableAttributes` and/or `searchableAttributes` in your `Settings.yaml`.

The search query builder currently supports the following features:
`query`, `sortDesc`, `sortAsc`, `limit`, `from`, `exactMatch`, `fulltext`, `nodeType`, `count` and `facets`.
